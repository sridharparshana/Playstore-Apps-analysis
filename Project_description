Project description

This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL,
 how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, 
 pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, 
 how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, 
 and visualize the data with the power bi tool.
